# Letters to Myself


## Higley Meadows Social Network
*October 10, 2020 at 12:15p*

Last night I started working on a social network app. I guess I started that on a whim. I was thinking about working on my notion like editor and I switched gears and started to plan the social network app. I purchased the higleymeadows.com domain name some time ago and I would like to host a very simple social network there just for neighbors, and see how that goes.

I do need to figure out what I want to do with my Notion like editor too. That will help me stay organized at work, I think.


## Protect an Old Computer
*October 9, 2020 at 2:20p*

I just posted this message on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).

I've got a working TRS-80 Color Computer 1 that was built sometime between 1980 and 1983. This is the same model that I used as a kid. I think my Mom purchased mine second-hand and I obtained and used it sometime around 1986. The one I have now was purchased on eBay about 10 years ago for $1.75.

I would like to put the computer into a working display, perhaps just on a desk somewhere. What should I do to protect it so that it can run for as long as possible?

For starters, I suspect I should condition the power to protect it from spikes. Is a decent surge protector enough?

What are the things that are most likely to kill the machine if I set it up and use it regularly?


## TRS-80 Programming
*October 9, 2020 at 1:55p*

I want to get out my TRS-80 computer and write some working software for it. I *copied* software into this machine as a kid but I never created my own application. I'd love to do that now and be able to run it on the machine that I purchased online a few years ago. That machine is currently stored in a cardboard box in my garage, I think.

I'd like to adapt that machine to a recorder of some sort so that I can CSAVE and CLOAD sofware. I believe it has a mono jack connection. When I was a kid we would connect it to a tape recorder. To record a program to tape we would press *record* on the recorder and then CSAVE onto tape. To load it back we would press *play* and then CLOAD it in. I'd like to reproduce that using something like a digital voice recorder with a mono aux cable.

What kind of software would I write for it? I have no idea. Maybe a little editor would be cool and easy, but the keyboard on the TRS-80 is so poor that it couldn't be used for much writing. A text adventure game would be an awesome demo of the machine. Some art work would be cool too, something similar to what I've been doing with JavaScript in the Splash of Code book. I could also write a program for drawing (maybe pixel art) and/or a program for loading images. How cool would it be to create an image on a modern computer and be able to load that into the TRS-80 and display it?


## Monthly Reviews
*October 9, 2020 at 1:15p*

I should review these letters at least once a month. Maybe that will help me stay in my "creative mode" and remind me to expand on some of these ideas. My idea is that these are just my random ramblings but they can eventually become more complete blog posts.

I also need a blogging platform again. I want that to be on joeldare.com and that's stopping me because I have my wiki and a bunch of other random stuff hosted on that domain. Converting it to a static site.

I added a little "deploy" script to this project so that I can just run `./deploy.sh` and it gets pushed to Github.


## Pure React
*October 9, 2020 at 1:00p*

I've been thinking about React more lately. I've been using React for around 4 years and I just can't bring myself to like it. The other day, however, I was working on a project and thought, "React would be good for this." That was the first time I had that feeling.

So, I decided to write down a list of my React Con's. As I'm writing this, I'm not sure exactly where I put those, but I suppose it doesn't matter. Then, over the past few days, I've started to write a program in React that avoids those cons.

At it's root, React is just a JS framework. It's the way they recommend that you use it and the way that the industry uses it that's bothering me. At least, for the most part. I do remember that I wrote something like, "Created by an evil company" on my list. That isn't going away. React was created by employee's at Facebook and I think Facebook is as evil as a corp as you can get these days.


## Starting to Write to Myself
*October 9, 2020 at 11:45p*

I need to write more. Sometimes It's hard to write because my thoughts aren't polished. So, I've decided to try writing to myself. I'm going to try to keep these letters to technical topics of things I'm working on, or thinking about, right now. I won't talk about my other hobbies unless there is a technical aspect to them. As an example, I won't write about making music, but I might write about software that I've created that helps me make music.
