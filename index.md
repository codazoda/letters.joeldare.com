# Letters to Myself

##Monthly Reviews
*October 22, 2020 at 1:15p*

I should review these letters at least once a month. Maybe that will help me stay in my "creative mode" and remind me to expand on some of these ideas. My idea is that these are just my random ramblings but they can eventually become more complete blog posts.

I also need a blogging platform again. I want that to be on joeldare.com and that's stopping me because I have my wiki and a bunch of other random stuff hosted on that domain. Converting it to a static site.

I added a little "deploy" script to this project so that I can just run `./deploy.sh` and it gets pushed to Github.


##Pure React

I've been thinking about React more lately. I've been using React for around 4 years and I just can't bring myself to like it. The other day, however, I was working on a project and thought, "React would be good for this." That was the first time I had that feeling.

So, I decided to write down a list of my React Con's. As I'm writing this, I'm not sure exactly where I put those, but I suppose it doesn't matter. Then, over the past few days, I've started to write a program in React that avoids those cons.

At it's root, React is just a JS framework. It's the way they recommend that you use it and the way that the industry uses it that's bothering me. At least, for the most part. I do remember that I wrote something like, "Created by an evil company" on my list. That isn't going away. React was created by employee's at Facebook and I think Facebook is as evil as a corp as you can get these days.


## Starting to Write to Myself

I need to write more. Sometimes It's hard to write because my thoughts aren't polished. So, I've decided to try writing to myself. I'm going to try to keep these letters to technical topics of things I'm working on, or thinking about, right now. I won't talk about my other hobbies unless there is a technical aspect to them. As an example, I won't write about making music, but I might write about software that I've created that helps me make music.
